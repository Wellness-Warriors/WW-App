## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

        - Qadree: Leadership, focus
        - Lorenzo: Work ethic, goal oriented
        - Allee: Communication, organization
        - Shelby: Time management, project/task management 
  - How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
        - Our strengths work well together within a group and we will be able to support each other throughout our work by leaning on these strengths of each other and learning from each other.

        - Qadree: Technical, tool proficiency
        - Lorenzo: Technical, communication(speaking)
        - Allee: Technical, tool proficiency
        - Shelby: Technical, ambiguity
  - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - We will work in a full group or by pairs so that we can talk through the pieces of our project to make sure that everyone has understanding of the tasks and the code.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
  - Describe at least:
      - What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
        - Talk it out, be respectful, practice psychological safety. 
      - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
        - Revisit the task list and possibly redistribute responsibilities. 
      - How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
        - Create an environment where the person who has the strength is creating a learning opportunity for the person who needs better understanding. Lean on/partner with each other. 
      - How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
        - Revisit the task list and discuss again. 
      - How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
        - We will bring in Michelle to escalate if anything becomes unmanageable. 

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
  - Describe at least:
      - What hours will you be available to communicate?
        - Class time - 6:30-9:30p. After 9:30p and/or Sunday if needed.
      - What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

      - How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
        - Slack
      - What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
        - Open floor discussions, quick sync review ahead of getting started on tasks each day. 
      - How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
        - We have group agreement/we are all on the same page that everyone has a right to speak up and be heard. 

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
  - Describe at least:
      - How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
        - Discuss tasks as a group and identify what folks are good at for possible individual tasks and what some would like exposure to to learn more and make those paired or full group tasks.  
      - What project management tool will be used?
        - Trello board.

## Git Process

  - Describe at least:
      - What components of your project will live on GitHub?
        - All code files.
      - How will you share the repository with your teammates?
        - We are going to create an organization so all members have equal access.
      - What is your Git flow?
        - Work on tasks > create a PR > have at least two members (other than yourself) approve the PR
  - Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
      - How many people must review a PR?
        - Two group members, not yourself.
      - Who merges PRs?
        - Anyone can as soon as two people have approved.
      - How often will you merge?
        - At least every night.
      - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
        - Slack the group.
