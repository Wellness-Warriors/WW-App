Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

**Security**

- The app uses Auth0 to securely log the user in.
- The app allows user data to be saved without fear of being public.
- The user password is hidden.

**Performance**

- Once deployed to Netlify the app will perform with moderate speed.
- Provides multiple modes of interactivity.
- Used google pagespeed insights to analyze the performance of the site.

etc….
Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
